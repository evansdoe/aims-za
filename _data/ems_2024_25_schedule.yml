  done-topics:
    - <p style="font-size:14px;">
        We gathered the data that students had collected thus far on the Frobenius number and conductor for certain values, but found it insufficient.
      </p>
    - <p style="font-size:14px;">
        We then reviewed the notebook for Day 2, though we did not cover the exploratory questions in the notebook. I encouraged the students to formulate 
        their own exploratory questions, resulting in the following list&#58;
        <ul style="font-size:14px;">
            <li>If \(a\) and \(b\) share a common factor greater than \(1\), is there a Frobenius number and conductor?</li>
            <li>If \(a\) is even and \(b\) is odd, what are the Frobenius number and conductor?</li>
            <li>If \(a\) and \(b\) are not coprime, what are the Frobenius number and conductor?</li>
            <li>If the Frobenius number is infinite, is it always true that the conductor is also infinite, and vice versa?</li>
            <li>Is there a case where a Frobenius number exists but not a conductor?</li>
            <li>What are the conditions for the existence of a Frobenius number and conductor given \(a\) and \(b\)?</li>
            <li>If a Frobenius number and conductor exist, are they always unique?</li>
            <li>What happens if we consider more than two numbers, \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\)?</li>
            <li>
              Given that the Frobenius number and conductor exist, is there a relationship between the Frobenius number, 
              conductor, \(a\), and \(b\)? If so, find it or identify the cases where such a relationship exists.
            </li>
            <li>If either \(a\) or bb equals \(1\) (but not both), does a Frobenius number and conductor exist?</li>
            <li>If both \(a\) and \(b\) are \(1\), what are the Frobenius number and conductor?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    - <p style="font-size:14px;">
        I encouraged students to initially explore these questions using pen and paper before transitioning to their computers. Although students were able 
        to explore some of the questions in writing, most encountered significant challenges in translating their exploration into code. To address this, I 
        organized a one-hour tutorial session in the evening, for which the 
        <a href="ems_2024_25_day_02_starting_to_program_tutorial_session.ipynb" target="_blank">notebook</a> used is available in the resource section.

          We will have a handed-in assignment (both computer and written) on Saturday 9th November, 2024. 
          The problems to be handed-in will be on the Homework page on Thursday 7th November, 2024. 
          The following problems will start getting you ready for it. You won't be able to do everything, 
          but especially for <a href="#qxn4">4</a> and <a href="#qxn5">5</a>, I strongly encourage you to 
          start <em>trying</em> things and writing down what works and what doesn't work. Then for your 
          assignment, you will really know how to get going.

    - <p style="font-size:14px">
        I gathered feedback from the students on their progress in the course, including their understanding of the material and overall well-being.
      </p>
    - <p style="font-size:14px">
        We discussed the use of dictionaries instead of lists, and students were encouraged to modify the code in the tutorial notebook to incorporate 
        dictionaries.
      </p>
    - <p style="font-size:14px">
        We then proceeded to a discussion on mathematical proofs. The proof methods we covered included&#58;
        <ul style="font-size:14px">
          <li>Direct proofs</li>
            <ul style="font-size:14px">

                <li>Example 3.2.1 of restricted resource.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Proof by contrapositive</li>
            <ul style="font-size:14px">
              <li>Example 3.1.3 of restricted resource.</li>

            <ul style="font-size:14px">
              <li>Example 3.2.2 of restricted resource.</li>
              <li>Example 3.2.3 of restricted resource.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
      </p>
    - <p style="font-size:14px">
        For each method, I explained the underlying concepts and worked through examples with the students, using implication statements as a basis. 
        Students were also given opportunities to construct proofs individually and present their solutions to the class.
      </p>
    - <p style="font-size:14px">
        I introduced the concept of a "design space" in the context of proving mathematical statements. This concept encourages students to identify 
        their set of assumptions and determine precisely what needs to be proven. They can then use one of the proof strategies to reduce the problem 
        to its essential components. We practiced this approach with examples, and I asked students to write formal proofs for some of these exercises, 
        as demonstrated earlier on the board.
      </p>
    - <p style="font-size:14px">
        I reminded the class that writing formal proofs will be part of their homework assignment, due on Saturday, 9th November. Additionally, I 
        distributed resources on mathematical proofs and techniques for their reference. I explained the strategy of eliminating the \(\forall\) quantifier 
        and encouraged students to review the material on proof by mathematical induction, which was also included in the resources shared with them.

        Students spent the remainder of the lecture working with SageMath. I noticed that several students were importing Python libraries like

        in SageMath.

        I also demonstrated how to access the documentation for functions in SageMath, along with their source code. I emphasized that a useful 
        approach to understanding how a function works is to read its documentation and to test the examples provided by copying them into a 
        Jupyter notebook cell for further exploration to get a better understanding of the function.

        I encouraged students to review the helpful links I provided on the resource pages, which should support their work with SageMath and
