That means you should have at least one English sentence to explain each line of code that you write. This may be in a form of a comments or in a paragraph after each computation in your upyter notebook.\n",
    "- Similarly, do not simply write your explorations as lists of numbers, but write explanations of what you tried, and what didn’t work.\n",
