title: Sage Interact/Animate Group Presentations
---

***

> **"Best scientific illustration making use of the Sage `animate` or `@interact` features."**


- **Submission Deadline**: Thursday, 21st November, by 21:00.
- **Group Presentation**: Presentations will take place in class on Friday. Every group member is required to participate in the presentation. Each group will have 8 minutes to present, followed by a 4-minute question and answer session.

The submitted work should showcase the students' original ideas. Each submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Originality of the concept
- Quality of graphics and visual presentation
- Clarity and scientific depth of the message
- Explanation of ideas, including the application of Sage’s `@interact` feature
- Effectiveness in communicating the concept clearly

For additional inspiration and guidance, students may refer to the <a href="https://wiki.sagemath.org/interact" target="_blank">interact resources</a> and <a href="https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/" target="_blank">Wolfram Demonstrations</a> or explore other scientific illustrations available online. While online `@interact` examples can serve as inspiration, the submissions must primarily reflect the students' own work.

### Submission Protocol:
1. **Create an interact in ONE cell** within a Jupyter notebook.
2. **Provide an explanation** as described above in a separate text cell within the same Jupyter notebook.
3. **Include all group members’ names** prominently in the explanation.
4. **File Naming**: Name the file `your_group_name_interact_submission` (e.g., `group_1_interact_submission`) and download it as a Jupyter notebook.
5. **Submit**: Reply to the official announcement email from the instructor, attaching the Jupyter notebook. Ensure the notebook contains the names of all group members.
6. **Relax!**
