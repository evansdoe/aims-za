***

> **"Best scientific illustration making use of the Sage animation or @interact features."**

- **Submission Deadline**: Thursday 21st November by 21:00.
- **Winners announced** during class Friday.

#### The submitted work should contain original ideas of students. Group work is encouraged! The jury will consider the following aspects of each work:
- The originality of the idea
- The quality of graphics
- The scientific message and content
- The explanation of ideas and the possible application of the Sage "@interact"

The [interact resources](https://wiki.sagemath.org/interact) might be a good source of inspiration as well as knowledge, as are Wolfram Demonstrations or any scientific illustrations on the web. While @interacts found on the web may be used as inspiration, the submissions should be primarily students' work.

### Submission Protocol:
1. **Create an interact in ONE cell** in a worksheet.
2. **Explain it** as described above in ONE text cell in the worksheet.
3. **Put your name or all members of a group clearly** in the explanation.
4. **File Naming**: Call it `your_group_name_interact_submission` (for example, `group_1_interact_submission`) and download it as a Sage worksheet or a Jupyter notebook.
5. **Submit**: Reply to the official announcement email from the instructor, with the Sage interact worksheet or Jupyter notebook attached. Note that all worksheet submissions should contain the names of the group members.
6. **Relax!**
