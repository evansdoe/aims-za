### Course Format

The course is anticipated to be conducted in-person due to its highly interactive and discussion-based format. Students are expected and encouraged to actively participate in discussions, collaborate and contribute their ideas on problems addressed during the lectures. 

Initially, problems will be explored either on the board or with pen and paper before considering the use of the computer algebra software [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org) for further experimentation. 

Students will submit a daily report what we did in class to show their understanding, and to work on the daily exercises that will be given to them. Homework assignments to be submitted will contain some of the daily exercises, therefore, students are highly encouraged to do these daily exercises in the daily reports they will be submitting.

At the end of the course, there will be group projects in which students will utilize the SageMath **@interact** feature to illustrate and explain a either a new or an existing scientific/mathematical concept. Students will work in groups and present their projects to the class on the final day of the course. Winners will be awarded with prizes.
