    "- You must write, type, use Jupyter notebook, or use $\\LaTeX$ to submit homework. **ALL CODE MUST BE EXPLAINED**. That means you should have at least one English sentence to explain each line of code that you write. This may be in a form of a comments or in a paragraph after each computation in your upyter notebook.\n",
    "- Similarly, do not simply write your explorations as lists of numbers, but write explanations of what you tried, and what didn’t work.\n",
    "- Do **NOT** use internet resources, or GPT-like models for the exploration; for help with _SageMath_ or _Python_ you may search the internet, of course. You are also welcome to ask me or any of the tutors.\n",
    "- The starred (*) exercises are more important; you should be working on them early and often. To pass the course you should try to do all the starred exercises.\n",
