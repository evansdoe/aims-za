    "Our motivational problem is the following: \n",
    " - Given positive integers $a$ and $b$, what numbers $m$ can be written in the form $a\\,x+b\\,y$, where $x,\\,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge0}$? \n",
    "\n",
    "Given positive integers $a$ and $b$ if there is a positive integer $c$, with $c = a\\,x + b\\,y$ such that for all positive integers $n \\ge c$, there are non-negative integers $x$ and $y$ with $n = a\\,x + b\\,y$, then $c$ is called the *conductor* of $a$ and $b$. In other words, $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$ is the smallest positive integer that can be written as $a\\,x + b\\,y$ such that  all positive integers greater than or equal to $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$ are also writable. We will denote the conductor of $a$ and $b$ by $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$.  \n",
    "On the other hand, the largest positive integer $f$ that can not be written as $f = a\\,x + b\\,y$ is called the  *Frobenius number* of $a$ and $b$. We will denote this by $f_{\\{a,b\\}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has already led to several related questions. Hopefully you were able to explore the following questions and made interesting _conjectures_.\n",

    " - If $a$ is odd and $b$ is odd, what is the Frobenius number? \n",
    " - If $a$ and $b$ are prime numbers, what is the Frobenius number? \n",
    " - Given two positive integers $a$ and $b$, can we find a formula or some other means of computing the Frobenius number?\n",
    " - If $a,\\, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and $\\gcd(a, b) \\neq 1$, does the Frobenius number exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some questions that we possed together in class: \n",
    "- Given that either $a = 1$ or $b = 1$, but not both, is it possible to define a Frobenius number, $f_{\\{a,b\\}}$ and a conductor, $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$? If so what is it?\n",
    "- If $a$ and $b$ have a common factor greater than $1$, does there exist a Frobenius number, $f_{\\{a,b\\}}$ and a conductor, $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$?\n",

    "- If $f_{\\{a,b\\}}=\\infty$ for $a,\\,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, is it always true that the conductor, $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$ is also infinity. How about the vice-versa of this statement?\n",
    "- Is there a case such that given $a,\\,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ there exists a Frobenius number, $f_{\\{a,b\\}}$ but not a conductor, $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$?\n",
    "- What is the existence condition for a Frobenius number, $f_{\\{a,b\\}}$ and a conductor, $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$ given $a, b\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$?\n",
    "- If $a,b\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and there exist a Fronbenius number, $f_{\\{a,b\\}}$ and a conductor, $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$, is there a relationship between:\n",
