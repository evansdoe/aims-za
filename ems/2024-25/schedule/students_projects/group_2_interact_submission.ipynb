    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of relationships between objects, represented as nodes (vertices) and the connections between them, called edges. Social networks are a perfect example of this, where people (users) are nodes, and their relationships, like friendships or followers, are the edges. This project aims to explore how graph theory and its associated matrices, such as the adjacency matrix and Laplacian matrix, can help us better understand the structure and dynamics of social networks (Bollobás, 1998).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Applications\n",
    "Social networks are integral to modern life, from platforms like Facebook and Twitter to professional networks like LinkedIn. Graph theory helps us:\n",
    "- Identify **influencers**: Who has the most connections and influence in a network?\n",
    "- Detect **communities**: Groups of users who interact closely.\n",
    "- Predict **trends**: How information, like news or viral content, spreads through the network.\n",
    "- Improve **recommendation systems**: Suggesting new friends, followers, or content based on shared connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph theory was introduced by Leonhard Euler in 1736 with his work on the famous \"Seven Bridges of Königsberg\" problem (Diestel, 2017). Over time, it has become a key tool in understanding complex systems in fields like communication, biology, and artificial intelligence. In the context of social networks, graph theory allows us to model and analyze connections, uncover patterns, and predict behaviors (Easley & Kleinberg, 2010).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on studying the mathematical properties of social networks using SageMath. We will:\n",
    "1. **Model Social Networks**: Represent users as nodes and their relationships as edges.\n",
    "2. **Analyze Graph Properties**:\n",
    "   - Use the **adjacency matrix** to understand direct connections between users.\n",
    "   - Use the **Laplacian matrix** to study community structure and identify influencers or isolated groups.\n",
    "3. **Visualize Networks**: Create interactive and customizable graphs to better understand the relationships between users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal of Implementation\n",
    "The goal of this code is to fetch user data from the JSONPlaceholder API and create a network graph based on the user IDs. It builds a graph with the main user as the central node and connects it to other users via edges. Using `@interact from ipywidgets`, the code allows dynamic visualization of the graph, where users can adjust parameters like the number of vertices, edges, vertex size, and edge thickness. It also computes and displays the adjacency matrix and Laplacian matrix of the graph. Finally, the graph is visualized interactively with customizable styling options for the nodes and edges."

    "In the future, we recommend exploring more ways to analyze social networks, such as finding key users, understanding how communities form, and studying how information spreads over time. Using real-world data from platforms like Facebook or Twitter can make the results more practical. Machine learning techniques, like Graph Neural Networks, can help predict user behavior or suggest new connections. It’s also important to consider privacy and ethical issues, like protecting user data and avoiding misuse. Lastly, creating better visualization tools and working with experts from other fields, like sociology or psychology, can help make this research more useful and easy to understand for everyone."
