### Abstract

The use of a computer algebra system introduces mathematicians to an innovative approach to problem-solving through experimentation. This course demonstrates how such experiments can assist in resolving mathematical challenges, particularly in proving or disproving mathematical assertions. These experiments necessitate the use of computational tools; in this course, we will focus on the System for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org).

The course will provide an overview and introduction to the [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org) computer algebra system, highlighting its features and applications across various mathematical domains, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus. Our primary focus will be on problems in **Discrete Mathematics**, such as *Number Theory*, *Linear Algebra*, and potentially some aspects of *Graph Theory*.

Additionally, we will explore relevant programming concepts, revisit data types, and engage with plotting functions, curves, geometric figures, and interactive visualizations. By the conclusion of this course, students are expected to be proficient in using the [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org) computer algebra system and capable of creating their own [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org) notebooks for diverse applications.
